## What is the cause of this issue?

This usually occurs when the instance you are trying to roll up is missing a .git folder from the backup.  
Mdoq need you to include the .git folder for your project so it can determine what it needs to do and where it needs to pull from.

## Troubleshooting
- make sure your code backups are upto date, and include a .git folder.

If you have done this and you are still getting the error please [contact us](maxilto:{{ site.email}}).
