## What is the cause of this issue?
Uncommitted files were found. This is caused when Mdoq is trying to prepare your instance for a release. 
During this process Mdoq looks for any files that could be added to Git. It does this to remove the possibility that development would be lost when the instance is closed down.  
This isn't necessarily a bad thing, it could just mean that this file needs adding to your .gitignore.

## Troubleshooting
- *If the file has changes you want to keep*  
  Use [Git Push](/documentation/instance/github.html#git-push) to commit the work and restart the process
- *If the file is always going to be present but you never want it in git*  
  Add the file to your .gitignore file, and [Git Push](/documentation/instance/github.html#git-push) this change.
- *If you don't care about this file*  
  When starting the release process for your instance select "Ignore uncommitted files".
