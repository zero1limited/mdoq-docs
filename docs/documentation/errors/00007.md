## What is the cause of this issue?
Unable to determine the current branch reference. This happens when Mdoq is unable to determine the latest git commit for your instance. 
This is quite rare and can usually be resolved following the troubleshooting steps below. 
However if you are still unable to proceed with the release process please [contact us](mailto:{{ site.email}}).

## Troubleshooting
- confirm you can get to the frontend of your instance
- [Git push](/documentation/instance/github.html#git-push) on your instance, this should highlight if there is a bigger issue.
- [Recreate code](/documentation/instance/components.html#recreate) on your instance, (be aware this will lose any uncommitted changes)
- try the release process again.
