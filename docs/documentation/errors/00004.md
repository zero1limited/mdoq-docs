## What is the cause of this issue?
The branch for this instance is not ahead of the intended target branch. 
This is usually caused by work being carried out on the target branch (where you are trying to merge your work into) has had work carried out 
(or merged in) since you start the release process for your instance.


## Troubleshooting
To resolve this simply [merge the target branch](/documentation/instance/github.html#merging-in-branches) back into your instance, and begin the release process again.
