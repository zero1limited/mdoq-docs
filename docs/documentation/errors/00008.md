## What is the cause of this issue?
Gits latest version of your branch is different to the version of your branch checked out on your instance.  
This happens when work has been carried out on the git branch your instance is tied to, externally to Mdoq. 

## Troubleshooting
Just [Git Pull](/documentation/instance/github.html#git-pull) the changes onto your instance and start the release process again.
