## What is the cause of this issue?
Pull request already closed. There are a number of causes for this issue, but the most common is someone closing/accepting a pull request in Github before Mdoq does. 
Mdoq will create a pull request and then try to re-use that pull request for any further merges.   

## Troubleshooting
When this error occurs Mdoq drops its reference to the old pull request, so any future attempts will create a new pull request.  
Simply restart the release process.
