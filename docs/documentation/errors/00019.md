## What is the cause of this issue?
As part of Mdoq's processes, certain things are checked when preparing an instance for regression tests. 
This includes checking for files that have been changed that haven't been committed to source control. 
This is just a last minute check to make sure you don't lose work accidentally. If you have changes to files that 
are source controlled and you don't want to take live simply check the "ignore uncommitted" option, when 
following the "I'm Done" process.
