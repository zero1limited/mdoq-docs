## What is the cause of this issue?
This issue usually occurs when MDOQ is unable to connect to the MDOQ Connector on the instance/production site. This could be for a number of reasons, and isn't usually something to be worried about.

## Troubleshooting
- Visit your instance, using the links from the detail page and confirm it can be accessed. Sometimes development on an instance can cause the frontend of magento to become inaccessible, meaning Mdoq is unable to talk to your instance.  
  Resolving this issue should allow Mdoq to talk to your instance again.
