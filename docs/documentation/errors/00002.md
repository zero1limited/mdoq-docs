## What is the cause of this issue?
Work has been carried out since the release process started. Mdoq won't allow you to continue with the release because this would mean release changes that haven't been tested 
or packed into a deployment.

## Troubleshooting
To resolve this and get your instance up to date you can either 
[Git Pull](/documentation/instance/github.html#git-pull) 
or 
[Recreate Code](/documentation/instance/components.html#recreate) 

After doing this, simply begin the release process again. This time the error shouldn't occur.
