## What is the cause of this issue?
The branch for this instance is identical to the target branch. This happens when the work has been merged into the target branch (the branch where you selected your work to go) outside of Mdoq.  

## Troubleshooting
Depending on your requirements there a couple of things you can do:    
- *if you are happy your work is already in the target branch*
  delete this instance
- *you have further changes to make*
  continue development on your instance, then resume the release process as normal
