This SAK job guides you through changing your Magento admin path.

Changing your admin path regularly is best practice when it comes to security. With MDOQ, you can choose your own path, or let MDOQ generate a secure randomised one for you (reccomended).

In addition to changing the admin path, it also emails all admin users with the updated path so you don't have to worry about letting everyone know.
