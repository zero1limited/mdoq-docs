MDOQ can protect your production website and infrastructure from threats. Most Magento Extension vendors will require access to a running version of your site where any issues exist in order for them to provide effective support. With MDOQ you can rest assured that an MDOQ instance will protect your site and business from unwanted risks in providing 3rd party access to your site.

For this feature you will need an instance. If you don't know how to roll up an instance click [here](/tutorials/create-a-new-istance.html).
