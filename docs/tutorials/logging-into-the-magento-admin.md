This feature is ONLY available within the integrated aspect of MDOQ development instances and bears no risk to production instances. This login mechanism is simply to aid 1st line support efficiency so that staff can quickly investigate issues. Following the example below you can login as any user, you will not see their credentials and this service only works if you have a 'lite' database backup (which contains no customer or order information).
